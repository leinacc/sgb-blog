# Donkey Kong (1994)

## Pauline's 'Help' voice

A few SGB games make use of sound-related SGB packets. Some that do, will send Kankichi-formatted data to ARAM at $2b00 (music score area) via `SOU_TRN`, then send a `SOUND` command to play 1 of the loaded in songs.

Donkey Kong takes it a step further. In bank $0c, address $5ddd (rom offset $61ddd), `SOU_TRN` data is sent to that music score area that can play the voice sample, and also has some misc Kankichi commands at certain periods to further manipulate the voice sample.

Then later, at address $6438 (rom offset $62438), more data is sent:

```
	.dw $0004 ; size of transfer
	.dw $4b08 ; apu dest
	.dw $3b00, $46a3

	.dw $0006
	.dw $4c3c
	.db $02, $ff, $e0, $b8, $02, $b0

	.dw $0bb0
	.dw $3b00
    <$bb0 bytes of sample data>
```

* `$4b08` - There are 63 `DIR` entries for samples and their loop points at $4b00. $4b08 is the entry for sample 2, which sets its address to $3b00
* `$4c3c` - There is data for 63 [instruments](https://sneslab.net/wiki/N-SPC_Engine#Instrument_Format) at $4c30, which determines sample to use, adsr1/adsr2/gain values and a pitch base multiplier
* `$3b00` - This is sample 2 data: the voice sample encoded in BRR format.
